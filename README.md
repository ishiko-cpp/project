## Installation

### Third-party dependencies

First the third-party dependencies need to be installed. These are available in the
[ishiko-third-party organization](https://github.com/ishiko-third-party). There are no dependencies between them so the
build order doesn't matter but we define the following order for consistency.

1. fmt
1. Botan
1. pugixml
1. mstch

### Installing Botan

On Windows:

```
git checkout 2.19.1
python ./configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows --disable-shared-library --debug-mode
```

Then open a Visual Studio build shell and run:
```
nmake
nmake check
nmake install
```
