## Installation

### Third-party dependencies

First the third-party dependencies need to be installed. These are available in the
[ishiko-third-party organization](https://github.com/ishiko-third-party) except for Boost which you get from the
boost.org website. There are no dependencies between them so the build order doesn't matter but we define the following
order for consistency.

1. Boost
1. fmt
1. Botan
1. pugixml
1. mstch

### Installing Boost

Download the archive from the boost.org website. The instructions below are for Windows but they translate directly to
bash.

```
C:\>set ISHIKO_WORKSPACE=<workspace_root_dir>
C:\>set ISHIKO_INSTALL_DIR=%ISHIKO_WORKSPACE%\Installation
C:\>set ISHIKO_PROJECTS_DIR=%ISHIKO_WORKSPACE%\Projects

C:\>cd /d %ISHIKO_PROJECTS_DIR%\boostorg\boost_1_90_0
C:\>.\bootstrap.bat
C:\>.\b2 install --prefix=%ISHIKO_INSTALL_DIR%
```

### Installing fmt

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. ..
cmake --build . --config=Debug
cmake --build . --config=Release
cmake --install . --config=Debug
cmake --install . --config=Release
```

This installs the libraries in the lib folder at the root of the repo. The last step is to rename the files to adopt
the Boost naming convention: fmt-d-x64.lib.

### Installing Botan

On Windows:

```
git checkout 2.19.5-fix
python ./configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows --disable-shared-library --debug-mode --prefix=..\..\..\..\..\Installation
```

Then open a Visual Studio build shell and run:
```
nmake
nmake check
nmake install
```
